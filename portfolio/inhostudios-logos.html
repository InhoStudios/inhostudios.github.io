                                    The design used for the final is this one, an interation of a logo I had made previously, with a changed colour scheme.
                                    The font used is Kollektif, which is probably my favourite font right now. I seriously use it on everything. 
                                    The logo is both a personal logo for my own resume, as well as the logo for my design portfolio and website (which you see here).
                                    The symbol in the icon is a combination of my initials, A, S, and Z. It's combined in a sort of abstract manner, to create the icon you see here.

                                    This is the first logo I had designed with this icon style. It was just a very simple, black and white icon,
                                    and lacked personality. I designed this in photoshop and exported it as a PNG and JPEG file, as it was mostly drawn and not SVG-able.

                                    This is the first variation, where I tried using the highlighter colours and style.
                                    I also added the hard edges to the icon, compared to the rounded edges of the original.
                                    I had some issues with the placement of the highlighter marks, which I changed in the final.

                                    This was an experimentation of highlighter colours. I saw that just the highlight portions together
                                    looked decent, so I decided to see if I could make a logo out of it. The logo looks good, but didn't quite appeal to me, 
                                    especially in icon form.
