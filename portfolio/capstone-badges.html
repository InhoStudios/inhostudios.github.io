                                    The design used for the final is this one, an interation of a logo I had made previously, with a changed colour scheme.
                                    The font used is Kollektif, which is probably my favourite font right now. I seriously use it on everything. 
                                    The logo is both a personal logo for my own resume, as well as the logo for my design portfolio and website (which you see here).
                                    The symbol in the icon is a combination of my initials, A, S, and Z. It's combined in a sort of abstract manner, to create the icon you see here.

                                    This was the initial design first created for AP Capstone. 
                                    It was created during the phase of time when I thought shield badges were cool. 
                                    It was also created before I discovered Kollektif. 
                                    The font in the logo is Adequate, a wide, clean and thin lined typeface. 
                                    The icon in the centre represents the letters AP, in the shape of a mountain.
                                    I personally really liked this design, but most of our class thought it was too simplistic.

                                    This was a redesign of the design above, with thinner lines and a slight modification of designs.
                                    The AP emblem had an upward angle rather than a downward angle on the lower chin.
                                    The design is cleaner, and the mountain is more obvious, but that sacrifices the AP letters. These designs are iterated on slightly, but later scrapped for different styles.

                                    This design uses a sword and telescope from my friends design. I added a banner around the center to cut the two designs in half. The font used
                                    for the text is Dosis, which is slim and narrow, but not quite the right feel.

                                    This design was a complete redesign, using a more retro or vintage aesthetic. It uses some hipster cursive font, and honestly
                                    I think this is one of the better designs. It's a very clean design, while giving off the same vintage feel. This design was iterated upon,
                                    but this original version still looks the best (in my opinion).

                                    This wolf design is another drastic redesign. During this period, I had seen a hoodie with a similar design on it, so I attempted
                                    to recreate it. This was an interesting experiment, where I learned the pen tool better. The font used is Adequate, and the mountain
                                    motif is used once again.

                                    This design takes the mountain design and extracts it from the wolf design. This design would have been a cool hoodie, but it didn't look the greatest.
                                    The capstone people also really didn't like the mountain motif, for some odd reason. They wanted to be "original" or something I guess. Oh well.

                                    This logo was the final selection in our vote. Since our entire class was allowed to design, we were only allowed to select one to submit, so I chose
                                    this one. It follows the vintage style from the earlier style, but had a lot of variations to create the current design. It won in a knockout type
                                    of voting, and is <i>nearly</i> the final design. The final tweak was changing the 18 20 for the date to 2018 and 2020.
