                                For my own personal website and development, I made a set of logos and colour palettes. The font used in the text is Kollektif, and the logo is supposed to embody
                                an artsy feeling, while keeping those hard edges and corners. I chose to use pastel and pale colours to bring a more soft, welcoming feel. Original logos
                                used a much harsher, highlighter blue and yellow colour pattern, which was a lot more jarring and hard to look at. The slight offset of logo design itself 
                                is an anagram on my initials, ASZ. The Z is typically the most obvious, but the A and S also exists to some extent in the right side. My original design
                                tried more to show the letters, but a more abstract approach seemed to look better.

                            The Vikings Dev logo was designed for Burnaby North's Coding Club. It was designed with a very
                            simple goal in mind: incorporate our schools mascot into a coding environment. Since our club is
                            called "Vikings Dev," I decided to draw a Viking head in a pair of braces. I decided to add a stroke
                            to the logo to make it look more friendly and cartoon-like, but the logo also exists in a stroke-less 
                            state for certain use cases.
