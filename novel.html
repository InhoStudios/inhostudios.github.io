                                Alone. I’m finally alone. Breathing a sigh of relief, I collapse onto the sofa and let out a meek cry of victory. His bedroom, for the first time in a year, does not have the heavy scent of smoke and sweat. The refrigerator is finally free of his spoiled leftovers that were so adamantly kept for their ‘sentimental value.’ I close my eyes and take a deep breath. After a long day of cleaning the tiny apartment, I could finally revel in my handiwork. I sit down and listen to the peaceful sound of the rain and the road through my small apartment window. But I am not quite done yet.
                                <br><br>
                                I force my eyes open and I glance around at my surroundings. Most of the cupboards in the kitchen are left wide open. A giant trash bag occupies the middle of the small space, filled with week old food and mysterious substances. Dirty dishes long ago stained by food and cups still holding old tea leaves fill the cramped sink.
                                <br><br>
                                Struggling to pull myself away from the comfort of the couch, I start to close the cupboards while grabbing my favourite mug in the process. I fill up a kettle with water and set it on the stove to boil. I pull up my sleeves, exposing my arms, and begin scrubbing at the pile of dishes.
                                <br><br>
                                <i>Whiiirrrrrreeeee.</i>
                                <br><br>
                                The kettle begins whistling halfway through the pile of dishes. I reach over with my hand and turn off the heat while pouring some hot water into my mug.  Drying my hands on a towel, I spoon a bit of Darjeeling tea into my tea steeper—ornamented with a little whale on top—and plopped it into the mug. The tiny whale’s head bobs up and down in the water. I take a sip and look back at the half-finished tub of dishes.
                                <br><br>
                                “I’ll finish them later,” I tell myself, and plop myself down on to the couch, picking up my copy ofBag of Bones. The mug meets my mouth as I take a sip of the brewing tea. I open the book to my bookmark and began reading.
                                <br><br>
                                <i>Ding Dong.</i>
                                <br><br>
                                I groan as I drag my weary body off of the comfortable sofa and walk towards the door of my apartment. I peer through the peephole to take a look at who interrupted my rest. I wipe my eyes and see a hazy view of an old woman, wearing horn-rimmed glasses, a crooked nose and a permanent scowl on her face. I hastily unlock my door to greet her.
                                <br><br>
                                “Eliot, Hi! I didn’t expect to see you so soon,” I anxiously avert my eyes at her piercing gaze and invited her into my apartment room, “Would you like something to drink?”
                                <br><br>
                                “Water is fine, dear,” Eliot said.
                                <br><br>
                                I clamber towards the cupboard above the sink and grabbed a small mug, filling it with water from the filter I kept near the sink.
                                <br><br>
                                I set the water onto the coffee table in front of her and then pulled up a chair for myself.
                                <br><br>
                                “So what is the reason you’re here today Eliot?” I ask, pulling my chair a bit closer to her.
                                <br><br>
                                “Finn,” she gives a tired sigh, “I hate doing this to you so soon after your last roommate moved out, but housing prices are still rising. I’m going to have to increase the rent for next month. I know finances have been an issue recently, so I recommend you find a new roommate as fast as possible”
                                <br><br>
                                I collapse against my chair and gave a troubled sigh, my mind rapidly spinning, full of anxiety.
                                <br><br>
                                “Ok, ok. I’ll go make some ads then, I guess” I reply with a little stutter.
                                <br><br>
                                “I’m so sorry-”
                                <br><br>
                                “No, it’s okay. I’ll figure it out,” Despite her hard persona, Eliot is still a sweetheart.
                                <br><br>
                                “I hope you can get a roommate as fast as possible” Eliot says. She finishes her water and gets up to head out of the door, “Best of luck.”
                                <br><br>
                                I escort her to the door.
                                <br><br>
                                “Thanks for telling me in advance, Eliot, I’ll try and come up with something” I manage to mumble before closing the door behind her.
                                <br><br>
                                I stand in shock behind the door for a while before slowly trudging my way to the bathroom. I twist the door handle and turned the sink on before cupping the water in my hand and splashing it on my face.  My reflection stares back at me in the mirror, my brown locks dripping with water and piercing blue eyes on the verge of tears. I splash another handful of water at my face, rubbing the water out of my eyes.
                                <br><br>
                                “You can do this Finn, you can make it through this,” I mutter at my reflection.
                                <br><br>
                                My feet guide me out of the bathroom, towards the medicine cabinet. I open it, revealing a small medicine bottle labelled escitalopram. My name is written in fine print below. I open the bottle and slip a pill into my mouth, before swallowing it with a gulp of water. I make my way to my desk in the corner of my bedroom and open up Craigslist on my laptop. I put a quick posting for roommates. I open up Photoshop and quickly throw together a simple but elegant poster. I outlined the details of the room, the rules I expected, and my contact info on the poster, before hitting print.
                                <br><br>
                                The whirring of the miniature printer fills the room as it prints out a few copies of my poster in black and white. I sigh and grab it, along with a few thumbtacks, and went to the door. I tuck the poster and my laptop into my bag, put on my favourite jacket and a beanie, and grab my phone and earbuds. A cold gust of November wind hits me as I lock my door, signifying the beginning of winter. I shiver a bit before zipping up the front of my jacket and walking down the sidewalk of the now busy downtown street.
                                <br><br>
                                The wind blew past in torrents, as I made my way towards the cafe. After a few blocks, I saw the familiar grey signage and quickly huddled into the door, shivering. A familiar face greeted me at the counter.
                                <br><br>
                                “What’s the order? The usual?” Chloe asks me as I approach the counter.
                                <br><br>
                                She’s been working at this cozy, secluded cafe for as long as I’ve been going.
                                <br><br>
                                “You know me, you choose,” I reply, “By the way-”
                                <br><br>
                                “School’s been going well,” she cuts me off, “You always ask the same questions, Finn.”
                                <br><br>
                                “Dammit. How about your love life? Anything juicy?”
                                <br><br>
                                “Oh please,” she blushes, “Studying comes first. What about you? Didn’t your roommate move out recently?”
                                <br><br>
                                “Yeah, and my apartment never felt cleaner.”
                                <br><br>
                                “Thank God you kicked that horror of a man out. The guy looks like he never heard of a shower before. He should try some of Pavlov’s classical conditioning.”
                                <br><br>
                                <i>Right, Chloe is a psychology major.</i>
                                <br><br>
                                I give her a half-hearted smile and pretend I understand.
                                <br><br>
                                “So what are you going to do now that the rat is gone?”
                                <br><br>
                                “Gotta replace him. Rent is going up and the number of clients is going down,” I take out the stack of the posters I printed earlier, “By the way, can I pin some ads on the corkboard?”
                                <br><br>
                                “I don’t know, can you?” She grins, “I’m just kidding, of course you may.”
                                <br><br>
                                She hands me my drink, “Cafe macchiato just the way you like it. Three shots espresso, chocolate drizzle, peppermint shavings, and extra hot. Don’t burn your tongue off.”
                                <br><br>
                                “Thanks,” I reach for my wallet and pull out a ten dollar bill, “For your troubles, keep the change.”
                                <br><br>
                                I grab my drink and walk over to the corkboard, posters and thumbtacks in hand. After scanning the cluttered board, I select a prime location in the top right corner and pin my poster in place. I slide into the table near the window and pull my laptop out of my bag, and place it onto the table. I pull the lid up and the login screen pops up.
                                <br><br>
                                Two clients left today.
                                <br><br>
                                I quickly type my password in, greeted by the open Photoshop window with my poster still on it. I open one of my projects. Hopefully, this was the last time I would have to see this design.
                                <br><br>
                                The bell on the door chimes and I give a curious glance at the person who comes in. The man has a young and effeminate face masked by a rather pale complexion, and his black hair is pulled back in a short ponytail with still a few messy bangs. He looks to be about five foot six but has a frail body that seems like it could be blown over by a gust of wind. Covering his body is a black overcoat with grey faux fur ruff at the rim of his hood, a black backpack with a water bottle clipped on to the side. He was wearing ripped black jeans, stained by dust, probably from the time spent outside.
                                <br><br>
                                Paying less than half a second of attention, I turn to face my laptop again. No more wasting time.
