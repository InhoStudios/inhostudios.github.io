                        <p>
                                Alone. I’m finally alone. Breathing a sigh of relief, I collapse onto the sofa and let out a meek cry of victory. His bedroom, for the first time in a year, does not have the heavy scent of smoke and sweat. The refrigerator is finally free of his spoiled leftovers that were so adamantly kept for their ‘sentimental value.’ I close my eyes and take a deep breath. After a long day of cleaning the tiny apartment, I could finally revel in my handiwork. I sit down and listen to the peaceful sound of the rain and the road through my small apartment window. But I am not quite done yet.
                                <br><br>
                                I force my eyes open and I glance around at my surroundings. Most of the cupboards in the kitchen are left wide open. A giant trash bag occupies the middle of the small space, filled with week old food and mysterious substances. Dirty dishes long ago stained by food and cups still holding old tea leaves fill the cramped sink.
                                <br><br>
                                Struggling to pull myself away from the comfort of the couch, I start to close the cupboards while grabbing my favourite mug in the process. I fill up a kettle with water and set it on the stove to boil. I pull up my sleeves, exposing my arms, and begin scrubbing at the pile of dishes.
                                <br><br>
                                <i>Whiiirrrrrreeeee.</i>
                                <br><br>
                                The kettle begins whistling halfway through the pile of dishes. I reach over with my hand and turn off the heat while pouring some hot water into my mug.  Drying my hands on a towel, I spoon a bit of Darjeeling tea into my tea steeper—ornamented with a little whale on top—and plopped it into the mug. The tiny whale’s head bobs up and down in the water. I take a sip and look back at the half-finished tub of dishes.
                                <br><br>
                                “I’ll finish them later,” I tell myself, and plop myself down on to the couch, picking up my copy ofBag of Bones. The mug meets my mouth as I take a sip of the brewing tea. I open the book to my bookmark and began reading.
                                <br><br>
                                <i>Ding Dong.</i>
                                <br><br>
                                I groan as I drag my weary body off of the comfortable sofa and walk towards the door of my apartment. I peer through the peephole to take a look at who interrupted my rest. I wipe my eyes and see a hazy view of an old woman, wearing horn-rimmed glasses, a crooked nose and a permanent scowl on her face. I hastily unlock my door to greet her.
                                <br><br>
                                “Eliot, Hi! I didn’t expect to see you so soon,” I anxiously avert my eyes at her piercing gaze and invited her into my apartment room, “Would you like something to drink?”
                                <br><br>
                                “Water is fine, dear,” Eliot said.
                                <br><br>
                                I clamber towards the cupboard above the sink and grabbed a small mug, filling it with water from the filter I kept near the sink.
                                <br><br>
                                I set the water onto the coffee table in front of her and then pulled up a chair for myself.
                                <br><br>
                                “So what is the reason you’re here today Eliot?” I ask, pulling my chair a bit closer to her.
                                <br><br>
                                “Finn,” she gives a tired sigh, “I hate doing this to you so soon after your last roommate moved out, but housing prices are still rising. I’m going to have to increase the rent for next month. I know finances have been an issue recently, so I recommend you find a new roommate as fast as possible”
                                <br><br>
                                I collapse against my chair and gave a troubled sigh, my mind rapidly spinning, full of anxiety.
                                <br><br>
                                “Ok, ok. I’ll go make some ads then, I guess” I reply with a little stutter.
                                <br><br>
                                “I’m so sorry-”
                                <br><br>
                                “No, it’s okay. I’ll figure it out,” Despite her hard persona, Eliot is still a sweetheart.
                                <br><br>
                                “I hope you can get a roommate as fast as possible” Eliot says. She finishes her water and gets up to head out of the door, “Best of luck.”
                                <br><br>
                                I escort her to the door.
                                <br><br>
                                “Thanks for telling me in advance, Eliot, I’ll try and come up with something” I manage to mumble before closing the door behind her.
                                <br><br>
                                I stand in shock behind the door for a while before slowly trudging my way to the bathroom. I twist the door handle and turned the sink on before cupping the water in my hand and splashing it on my face.  My reflection stares back at me in the mirror, my brown locks dripping with water and piercing blue eyes on the verge of tears. I splash another handful of water at my face, rubbing the water out of my eyes.
                                <br><br>
                                “You can do this Finn, you can make it through this,” I mutter at my reflection.
                                <br><br>
                                My feet guide me out of the bathroom, towards the medicine cabinet. I open it, revealing a small medicine bottle labelled escitalopram. My name is written in fine print below. I open the bottle and slip a pill into my mouth, before swallowing it with a gulp of water. I make my way to my desk in the corner of my bedroom and open up Craigslist on my laptop. I put a quick posting for roommates. I open up Photoshop and quickly throw together a simple but elegant poster. I outlined the details of the room, the rules I expected, and my contact info on the poster, before hitting print.
                                <br><br>
                                The whirring of the miniature printer fills the room as it prints out a few copies of my poster in black and white. I sigh and grab it, along with a few thumbtacks, and went to the door. I tuck the poster and my laptop into my bag, put on my favourite jacket and a beanie, and grab my phone and earbuds. A cold gust of November wind hits me as I lock my door, signifying the beginning of winter. I shiver a bit before zipping up the front of my jacket and walking down the sidewalk of the now busy downtown street.
                                <br><br>
                                The wind blew past in torrents, as I made my way towards the cafe. After a few blocks, I saw the familiar grey signage and quickly huddled into the door, shivering. A familiar face greeted me at the counter.
                                <br><br>
                                “What’s the order? The usual?” Chloe asks me as I approach the counter.
                                <br><br>
                                She’s been working at this cozy, secluded cafe for as long as I’ve been going.
                                <br><br>
                                “You know me, you choose,” I reply, “By the way-”
                                <br><br>
                                “School’s been going well,” she cuts me off, “You always ask the same questions, Finn.”
                                <br><br>
                                “Dammit. How about your love life? Anything juicy?”
                                <br><br>
                                “Oh please,” she blushes, “Studying comes first. What about you? Didn’t your roommate move out recently?”
                                <br><br>
                                “Yeah, and my apartment never felt cleaner.”
                                <br><br>
                                “Thank God you kicked that horror of a man out. The guy looks like he never heard of a shower before. He should try some of Pavlov’s classical conditioning.”
                                <br><br>
                                <i>Right, Chloe is a psychology major.</i>
                                <br><br>
                                I give her a half-hearted smile and pretend I understand.
                                <br><br>
                                “So what are you going to do now that the rat is gone?”
                                <br><br>
                                “Gotta replace him. Rent is going up and the number of clients is going down,” I take out the stack of the posters I printed earlier, “By the way, can I pin some ads on the corkboard?”
                                <br><br>
                                “I don’t know, can you?” She grins, “I’m just kidding, of course you may.”
                                <br><br>
                                She hands me my drink, “Cafe macchiato just the way you like it. Three shots espresso, chocolate drizzle, peppermint shavings, and extra hot. Don’t burn your tongue off.”
                                <br><br>
                                “Thanks,” I reach for my wallet and pull out a ten dollar bill, “For your troubles, keep the change.”
                                <br><br>
                                I grab my drink and walk over to the corkboard, posters and thumbtacks in hand. After scanning the cluttered board, I select a prime location in the top right corner and pin my poster in place. I slide into the table near the window and pull my laptop out of my bag, and place it onto the table. I pull the lid up and the login screen pops up.
                                <br><br>
                                Two clients left today.
                                <br><br>
                                I quickly type my password in, greeted by the open Photoshop window with my poster still on it. I open one of my projects. Hopefully, this was the last time I would have to see this design.
                                <br><br>
                                The bell on the door chimes and I give a curious glance at the person who comes in. The man has a young and effeminate face masked by a rather pale complexion, and his black hair is pulled back in a short ponytail with still a few messy bangs. He looks to be about five foot six but has a frail body that seems like it could be blown over by a gust of wind. Covering his body is a black overcoat with grey faux fur ruff at the rim of his hood, a black backpack with a water bottle clipped on to the side. He was wearing ripped black jeans, stained by dust, probably from the time spent outside.
                                <br><br>
                                Paying less than half a second of attention, I turn to face my laptop again. No more wasting time.

                                    I trudge down the sidewalk slowly with no particular destination in mind. The trees sway in the wind and the flowers follow its motion. The sound of a honking car interrupts my trance.
                                <br><br>
                                “Ugh,” I groan in frustration. Some people are so insensitive sometimes. I continue walking.
                                <br><br>
                                I pass by an alleyway behind a rather hipster cafe with a neon sign displaying its name, ‘Java-Licious,’ as though it was a clever name. I turn around again when out of the corner of my eye, I see a frail looking dog, starved beyond recognition. I walk down the alleyway hastily to get a clearer look at the dirtied mutt. The dog gives a cry of surprise and starts to tremble and whimper at my presence.
                                <br><br>
                                He must have been abused by some horrible people in the past. Poor thing.
                                <br><br>
                                I slowly approach and feel around my black overcoat for some food,  eventually pulling out a banana. I peel the banana and tear a piece off for the dog. Searching around the dirty alleyway, I spot a relatively clean plastic bowl. I grab it, unscrew my water bottle hanging from the side of my backpack, pour a bit into the bowl, and carefully place it in front of the dog.
                                <br><br>
                                “Come on now, I’m not going to hurt you, little guy,” I say with the friendliest grin I can muster.
                                <br><br>
                                The dog gingerly nudges his mouth towards the banana and quickly gobbles it up, before eagerly lapping up the water in the plastic bowl.
                                <br><br>
                                I carefully extend my hand for the dog to sniff before softly petting its fur, matted with dirt and dust from its time outside. I smile gently towards it, throwing the rest of the banana in its direction.
                                <br><br>
                                “Wish I could take you, but it’s not going to be safe where I’m going,” I grab my water bottle and slowly stand up, “Take care of yourself.”
                                <br><br>
                                I trudge out of the alleyway and make my way further down the block before seeing a rather cozy looking cafe at the corner.
                                <br><br>
                                “Aroma Mocha,” it said in grey signage. I step through the wooden door and a pleasant sound of chimes accompany my entrance. I take a look at my surroundings. A few wooden tables were arranged in an orderly manner across the place, each with a small vase on top. A typically plain, plaster wall is instead replaced by red bricks, giving the place a rustic feel. Paintings and motivational messages cover a good portion of the wall, and incandescent light bulbs hang from the ceiling. A large shelf filled with different types of tea and coffee sits beside the cashier.
                                <br><br>
                                “Hi! Welcome to Aroma Mocha!” A peppy young girl who seems no older than sixteen mans the register while greeting me.
                                <br><br>
                                “Thank you,” I say awkwardly.
                                <br><br>
                                I glance up at the menu positioned in the back of the cafe. I scan the blackboard, each item written with neat handwriting and accompanied by a hand drawn image.
                                <br><br>
                                “I’ll have the Sweet Rose London Fog, please,” I nervously order.
                                <br><br>
                                “Sure! That’ll be $4.50” she said.
                                <br><br>
                                I hastily hand her a five dollar bill and grab my change.
                                <br><br>
                                “Your drink will be finished soon, feel free to take a seat.”
                                <br><br>
                                I scan the cafe for a nice area to sit. A set of tables line the wide window on one side, and a long counter spans across the other. Glancing around, I find a table in a cozy corner of the cafe. A corkboard hangs above it, covered with papers and advertisements. On it, in bright colours, hangs a poster advertising “Roommate Needed”
                                <br><br>
                                <i>Perfect. I was just looking for a place to stay.</i>
                                <br><br>
                                I make my way towards the corkboard, eyes locked onto the ad. It details an apartment room rather close to the coffee shop, immediately interesting me.
                                <br><br>
                                <i>Hopefully, this building has a discreet entrance.</i>
                                <br><br>
                                “Sir, your drink is ready.” A voice pulls me out of my trance and I walk back to the counter to receive my drink.
                                <br><br>
                                “Thank you very much, uh,” I sneak a glance at her name tag, “Chloe.”
                                <br><br>
                                “It’s my pleasure!” She replies with a cheery smile.
                                <br><br>
                                I return the smile and attempt to continue the conversation, “I noticed that there’s an ad looking for a roommate on the corkboard. I was wondering if you could give me more info?”
                                <br><br>
                                “Oh you’re just in luck, the man who posted that ad is sitting right there!” she gestures in the direction of a young man sitting in the corner on his laptop. He has long, wavy brown hair ending in a comma bang, partially covered by a navy blue beanie. He wears an orange t-shirt with a Pegasus symbol in the middle, underneath a brown leather jacket. I notice his constant fidgeting—an elegant gold ring inlaid with a small strip of brilliant blue gemstones rolls along his fingertips.
                                <br><br>
                                “Finn! This gentleman is interested in your ad!” Chloe shouts at the young man.
                                <br><br>
                                I approach his table and he extends his hand for a handshake, “Hi, My name is Finn, it’s nice to meet you. Uh, why don’t you take a seat and we’ll talk more.”
                                <br><br>
                                I sit down in front of him, placing my drink on the wooden table between us.
                                <br><br>
                                “Before any negotiations, I’m just going to ask you a few generic questions. Is that fine with you?” Finn asks. His voice seems to quiver slightly.
                                <br><br>
                                “Sure, go ahead,” I take a sip of my drink. The warm and milky flavour mixed with hints of earl grey rapidly warms me up from the cold day.
                                <br><br>
                                “What’s your name and how old are you?” Finn asks as I put down my cup.
                                <br><br>
                                “My name is Samael Abelson, I’m twenty-two and studying at the university nearby.”
                                <br><br>
                                “Oh cool. What are you majoring in?” he asks me. His pinky and thumb push at his ring.
                                <br><br>
                                “I’m currently studying animation and web design,” I think about the dog I found in the alley, “Um, what’s your policy on pets?” I ask, hoping my anticipation isn’t too obvious.
                                <br><br>
                                “Oh, pets are allowed as long as they’re well trained,” he answers back. A wave of relief passes through my body.
                                <br><br>
                                “Oh thank God, I have a small dog, he’s an absolute treasure and is very well trained.”
                                <br><br>
                                “Oh, that’s wonderful!” Finn exclaims, clearly excited, “I’ve always wanted a dog but I’ve never had the time to get one or take care of one, so he is absolutely welcome.”
                                <br><br>
                                I fall back on to the back of my seat, a smile unknowingly stretching across my face.
                                <br><br>
                                <i>I think I’m going to like this guy.</i>
                                <br><br>
                                “Oh, um, do you use drugs or smoke?” Finn asked me.
                                <br><br>
                                “No, I absolutely cannot stand the smell of cigarettes,” I say, “But I do enjoy the occasional beer.”  
                                <br><br>
                                “Oh that’s great,” he replied, “So, the monthly rate will be about one thousand dollars. Will you be able to pay this much a month?”
                                <br><br>
                                “Yeah. I mean, I freelance in my spare time. It’s a pretty stable source of income, I’d say.” I reply back, eager to agree on a deal, “I think I can handle it.”
                                <br><br>
                                “Excellent,” He pulls out a card with his email and his address on it, “Why don’t you come over soon and we’ll finalize everything else. Let’s see… Does the twenty-first around lunch work for you? It’s a Saturday.”
                                <br><br>
                                “Sure, I should be free during that time. I don’t usually have many plans. By the way, what do you do for a living?” I inquire.
                                <br><br>
                                “I do graphics design for some companies and clients, and sometimes I do odd jobs here and there to help with rent.”
                                <br><br>
                                I turn my head to look out the window and to my astonishment, It was starting to rain. I curse under my breath and lament at my bad luck.
                                <br><br>
                                <i>The one day I don’t bring an umbrella.</i>
                                <br><br>
                                I let out a depressed sigh while looking out the window, watching the droplets race down the window to the bottom.
                                <br><br>
                                “You okay?” Finn interjects into my melancholic episode, reading into my sigh.
                                <br><br>
                                “It’s raining on the one day I don’t bring my umbrella.”
                                <br><br>
                                “Wai-what,” Finn promptly glances at the window, and notices the pouring rain, “Dammit, I brought my laptop in this weather.”
                                <br><br>
                                Finn scowled at the sky and then returned back to his work, defeated as though he could somehow affect the weather.
                                <br><br>
                                I quickly finish my drink while it’s still hot, and excuse myself from the table, promising to contact him later. He writes his number on a slip of paper and passes it to me.
                                <br><br>
                                “Here’s my number. Text me.” His warm smile meets my gaze.
                                <br><br>
                                “Uhh, yeah, sure,” I stutter, flustered,  “Thanks.”
                                <br><br>
                                <i>Wow.</i>
                                <br><br>
                                I tuck the paper into my overcoat, grabbing my mug, and head towards the little table on the side that held a metal bucket with a cute sign saying Dirty Dishes Here with a small cartoon next to it.
                                <br><br>
                                After carefully positioning the mug so that it won’t fall over into the bucket, I walk over to Chloe.
                                <br><br>
                                “Hi, do you happen to have any fresh fruit? Like an apple or something for sale?” I ask her, “It’s for my dog.”
                                <br><br>
                                “Yeah, we have some. They’re organic and locally sourced, so you can be sure of their quality,” Chloe replies.
                                <br><br>
                                She walks over to a little basket at the back labelled “Fresh Fruit” in permanent marker. My face reddens at how blind I must look to her right now.
                                <br><br>
                                “Here you go, that’ll be $1.00,” she cheerfully hands me the apple and I give her a 1 dollar coin, “Thanks for the business!”
                                <br><br>
                                “Thank you for the apple,” I replied back. My face burning.
                                <br><br>
                                I anxiously look at the sky as I open the door. The chimes accompany my exit.
                                <br><br>
                                I cover my head with my hood, the fur on the sides warming up my ears.  I walk back through the rain towards the pretentious neon-lit restaurant and head towards the back-alley way to check if the dog was still there. Sure enough, a brown little puppy, the size of a soccer ball, bounded over to me once I was in the alleyway.
                                <br><br>
                                “Hey there little guy,” I reach down to pet its head, the mischievous pup leaning up to lick at my hand, “Hey, look what I got for you!”
                                <br><br>
                                I pull the apple I just purchased out from my jacket and felt about in my back pocket for my butterfly knife. I quickly take it out, swinging the knife portion out, and began cutting the apple into bite-sized pieces. The dog starts munching the apples with abandon, juice flowing down from the side of its jaw. I start petting at its matted coat. I smile and stand up, beckoning the pup towards me. He follows behind my step, his tail wagging furiously.
                                <br><br>
                                “I think I’ll call you Frosty.”
