						<br>About inhostudios
					</h3>
					<p class = "portfolio-contents slowfade">
						<br>
						Hi! I'm Andy Shen (inho), currently a high-school student with a huge passion for computer science,
						programming, graphics design, and hardware. <br> <br>
						I started my interest in computers in the spring of 2013. I attended a local spring break camp and learned 
						the basics of coding logic. From there, I began experimenting on my own. Now, I am fluent in GML, Java, and am fairly
						proficient in C#. Currently, I'm experimenting with web design, using HTML and CSS. Many of my programming projects can be found
						under the 'Projects' tab.<br> <br>
						Graphics design is another one of my interests. This passion began in school, where I began designing logos, artwork, 
						and all sorts of different things for projects at school, clubs, or personal passion projects. You can find some of my work 
						in the 'Portfolio' tab. <br> <br>
						I also create a lot of videos and tech related content on a joint youtube channel, with my friend. We don't post very often,
						but feel free to check it out and give us some feedback. The content ranges from simple tech reviews to cinematics and tutorials.
						<br><br>
						As a student, I find it very enjoyable to be able to pursue my passions, and do things I'm interested in doing.
						If I could be an asset to your team, as a developer or a graphics designer, or you're interested in what I do, 
						feel free to contact me with the contact form below.
