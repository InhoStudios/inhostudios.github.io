						<br>About inhostudios
					</h3>
					<p class = "portfolio-contents">
						<br>
						Hi! I'm inho, currently a high-school student with a huge passion for computer science,
						programming, graphics design, and hardware. <br> <br>
						I started my interest in computers in the spring of 2013. I attended a local spring break camp and learned 
						the basics of coding logic. From there, I began experimenting on my own. Now, I am fluent in GML, Java, and am fairly
						proficient in C#. Right now I'm experimenting with web design, using HTML and CSS.<br> <br>
						Graphics design is another one of my interests. This passion began in school, where I began designing logos, artwork, 
						and all sorts of different things for projects at school, clubs, or personal passion projects. You can find some of my work 
						in the 'Portfolio' tab. <br>
						As a student, I find it very enjoyable to be able to pursue my passions, and do things I'm interested in doing.
						If anything I do interests you, feel free to contact me with the contact form below.
