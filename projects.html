                                a single oak tree that resides in the centre of the world, and must survive until rescue arrives.

                                Adventures in Pureia is the longest in-development project I have worked on. Beginning in early 2015,
                                this project has gone through many renditions, and a full storyline and game has already been planned.
                                The project is <i>ready</i> to be completed, it just needs to <i>be</i> completed. The estimated release
                                date is summer 2020.
