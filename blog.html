                                    Over the past month I've updated my website a whole lot. The home page, the new projects page, and the portfolio have all been updated.
                                    But sure that's cool and all, but what really has me excited right now is NWHacks. That's coming up in 2 days. And then, in two weeks, XDHacks
                                    is also running, which means two hackathons within the span of a month. I said 2019 was going to be busy, and I sure as hell wasn't wrong.

                                    This year is going to be quite a busy year, I feel. I've already had a good start. I'm working on a discord bot that
                                    detects and tracks profanity, as part of a new years resolution to swear less. I also started planning the 2019 video upload schedule.
                                    This month, you can expect mostly GameMaker development tutorials, as well as the NWHacks vlog, but some reviews and other
                                    videos are scheduled to be uploaded as well. Stay tuned. Of course, school is going to be busy too, so I'll see how much time
                                    I can squeeze for this stuff. Anyways, inho signing off.

                                    Happy New Years! I know I'm a week late, but for the new years, I have a bit more planned for the development of
                                    this website and programming in general. My programming new years resolutions: Finish AP Computer Science (obviously),
                                    Finish planning and restart/continue development of Adventures in Pureia, Clean up and release A Lone Oak, Make monthly 
                                    progress reports directly on this website, Produce more videos for Youtube, at least once a month, and Attend more hackathons.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Speaking of hackathons, I just got accepted into NWHacks, probably the biggest hackathon on the west coast. I'm so pumped.
                                    2019 is going to be an exciting year, so let's see how it turns out. Happy new years, everyone!

                                    First of all, tomorrow's December, which means I can slip into my cozy Christmas sweater without any judgement.
                                    Yay winter! I added my resume under the about page. It's not the most elegant solution, especially if viewing 
                                    on ultrawide monitors, but it works. I also added a novel my friend and I are working on. It's been a fun
                                    process working on that as well. Still a few changes until completion, but I'm almost there! Also, next blog 
                                    post is going to be using the new December2018 id and I'm excited.

                                    It's been a while since I've actually worked on the website, but at this state I have a minimum viable product
                                    for what I intend to do. I fixed the image carousel, fixed my css settings, and did a lot of work on the about
                                    page. Individual portfolio pages are still under construction, however.

                                    I finally managed to figure out how to resize the "navbar-brand" text in the navigation panel.
                                    Using a separate h3 tag and a class tag I was able to control the brand text independent of the 
                                    brand image and icon. I still need to work on the about page, the twitter and FAQ, and fill out 
                                    the portfolio with all of the designs I've created. I also need to make each link a separate page
                                    for more detail, but that will come later. <br> <br>
                                    The plan for the portfolio posts are to lay out each potential variation of the logo and add a brief
                                    description of how the logo was designed. I was also thinking of using an image carousel, but the 
                                    one on the home page has some weird gradiation on the edges. I am looking into changing the assets.

                                        The website is officially live now. I still need to set up the twitter form and the FAQ, and also fix scaling for 
                                        image carousel on the home page. The about page will also need work.

                                    Today I've mainly worked on setting up the site's main home page as well as the blog. This blog is semi modular, uses wrapping. 
                                    I used bootstrap.css, recommended to me by The BitSpud (thebitspud.github.io) to set up most of the main site and the blog section.
                                    Issues with scaling on the image carousel on the front page still exist, and the font family issues are yet to be resolved.
