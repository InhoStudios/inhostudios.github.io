                                I finally managed to figure out how to resize the "navbar-brand" text in the navigation panel.
                                Using a separate h3 tag and a class tag I was able to control the brand text independent of the 
                                brand image and icon. I still need to work on the about page, the twitter and FAQ, and fill out 
                                the portfolio with all of the designs I've created. I also need to make each link a separate page
                                for more detail, but that will come later. <br> <br>
                                The plan for the portfolio posts are to lay out each potential variation of the logo and add a brief
                                description of how the logo was designed. I was also thinking of using an image carousel, but the 
                                one on the home page has some weird gradiation on the edges. I am looking into changing the assets.

                                    I worked on other pages. Restructured the home page, built the portfolio page, and started work on the about page.
                                    The website is officially live now. I still need to set up the twitter form and the FAQ, and also fix scaling for 
                                    image carousel on the home page. The about page will also need work.

                                Today I've mainly worked on setting up the site's main home page as well as the blog. This blog is semi modular, uses wrapping. 
                                I used bootstrap.css, recommended to me by The BitSpud (thebitspud.github.io) to set up most of the main site and the blog section.
                                Issues with scaling on the image carousel on the front page still exist, and the font family issues are yet to be resolved.
